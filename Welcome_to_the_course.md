# Welcome to the Course!

## Welcome to study design and use of relational databases!

During the following weeks, you will learn the basics of relational databases. You will learn how to plan, design and implement a database and to query database with SQL. No previous experience is required.

All the course material can be found in this ViLLE course. There are some links to external material such as videos.

The course is divided into several **thematic** **rounds**. Each round contains **learning material** and **exercises** related to specific topic**.** Rounds can be completed at your own speed and order (by 15.6.2025) although following the pre-made order of rounds is recommended. Some rounds are dedicated for mid-term tests and final exams.

**Learning rounds are the following:**

- Introduction
- ER model 1
- ER model 2
- Relational model
- Normalization
- SQL 1: basic queries 
- SQL DDL & DML: creating database and inserting data
- SQL 2: more complex queries

**Test rounds:**

In addition, the course contains **rounds that are tests (mid-term tests).** These evaluate your knowledge and skills after completing certain thematic learning round(s). Test rounds have a limited time (e.g. 1 hour), limited number of attempts and hidden answers. Unlike exercises, tests can be done/answered only once. We recommend using ViLLE Classic version instead of ViLLE Lite version (change version in the top right menu) in tests and exams.

In order to avoid opening the test accidentally, each test round has **a password: *test***

Test points are included in your total points, but those are entered manually by the teacher once in two weeks. Check the last round named "Assessment" for points achieved in tests and exams.

Test rounds are the following:

- ER test
- Relational model and normalizattion test
- SQL basics + DDL/DML test
- SQL advanced test

**Practical Work and Exams are compulsory returns and have minimum points to pass the course.**

The course ends with a practical work and a final exam, **** which cover all the topics. The final exam is divided into two parts (design and use) and it can be done/answered only once like the tests. Minimum points to pass the exam is 15 points out of 60 points for each exam. In case your points are below the limit, the teacher can re-open the exam once. Re-openings are done once in two weeks until the end of the course 15.6.2025.

We recommend using ViLLE Classic version instead of ViLLE Lite version (change version in the top right menu) in tests and exams.
In order to avoid opening the exam accidentally, both exams have **a password: *exam***

Exam points are included in your total points, but those are entered manually by the teacher once in two weeks. Check the last round named "Assessment" for points achieved in tests and exams.

The practical work is reviewed and graded manually by the teacher. Practical work reviews by the teachers are done also once in two weeks. Minimum points to pass the practical work is 80 points out of 200 points.

Note, that all rounds may not be visible in the beginning of the course, because we are still modifying parts of the content. However, all rounds will be open as soon as possible and be free to complete with your personal schedule.
*All rounds will close 15.6.2025* *after which returns are not possible.*

**The preliminary division of points is the following:**

Tutorials: 550 points
Tests: 140 points
Practical work: 200 points
Final exam: 120 points
Total points: 1010 points

**Preliminary Points to Grade -table:**

An accepted grade is given in scale of 1 to 5, where 5 is the best. Completed course is worth 5 credits (ECTS).

Less than 660 points = not graded
660-729 points = grade 1
730-799 points = 2 
800-869 points = 3 
870-939 points = 4 
940-1010 points = 5

For example, a student got the minimum points from exams (30) and the practical work (80), but has done 90% of excercises (495) and got about third of the points in mid-term tests (55), the total points 660 are over the minimum and grade 1.

**Changing the name in Ville**

Check that your firstname and lastname are correct in Ville. Otherwise, we are not able to record the study credits in the end of the course. Open the menu on top right corner, select Settings, modify your name if necessary, select Save on top right corner.

## Doing the Exercises and Tests

Exercises are done in ViLLE.

Below is a short tutorial on how to complete the exercises. It is based on the Programming exercises but it applies to this course as well.

In addition to the tutorial above, it is always important to notify in SQL exercises, which database is in use. We will give guidance if other tools will be used or problems with Ville use appear.

We recommend to study the topics in the order provided: Start with the first topic and its first exercise - remember, that you can try any exercise as many times as you want!

Tests and final exam are similar to exercises (you can return your answer many times), but time limits and answer visibility may apply.

## Support

You can ask for assistance for any exercise or any other problems in the Discord server:

## After completing the course

- After the exam, the teacher will give a grade.
- The course credits and grade will be visible in Peppi system of Turku University of Applied Sciences and (after data transfer) in the national MyStudyInfo -service: https://opintopolku.fi/oma-opintopolku/
- MyStudyInfo works as a service to transfer credits to other universities.

- In addition, you can get an official study transcription as a pdf into your email by sending a request to email address: avoinamk@turkuamk.fi
